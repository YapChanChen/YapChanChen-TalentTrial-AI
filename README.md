# TalentTrial-AI: Smarter Pre-Interview Assessments

   - Creativity
   - Communication skills
   - Ethical decision-making

   Responses are analyzed in real-time to produce:
   - A **Capability Profile**: A multidimensional report showcasing the candidate‚Äôs strengths and areas for improvement.
   - **Strategic Insights**: Actionable recommendations to guide follow-up interviews.

4. **Portable Assessments**  
   Results can be shared across different teams or departments, streamlining the hiring process and enabling collaborative decision-making.

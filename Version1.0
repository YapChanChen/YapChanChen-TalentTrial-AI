# TalentTrial-AI: Capability-Oriented Pre-Interview Assessment

**TalentTrial-AI** is an experimental AI-driven tool designed to create bespoke, role-specific assessments. It evaluates a candidate‚Äôs real-world thinking and problem-solving skills‚Äî*before the formal interview begins*.

## üåü Purpose

In today‚Äôs hiring process, resumes and credentials often fail to capture a candidate's true capabilities. **TalentTrial-AI** shifts the focus from what candidates *claim* they can do to what they can *demonstrate* under realistic, time-constrained scenarios.

> **This project is not meant to replace interviews‚Äîit‚Äôs here to make them smarter.**
